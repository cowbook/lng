## Preface

In 2024, the global economy experienced moderate recovery amid intensifying major power competition and regional conflicts. The global energy landscape and trade flows continued to adjust, and energy prices further declined. China’s natural gas industry, guided by the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and subsequent plenary sessions, adhered to the principles of high-quality development and high-level security. Natural gas consumption maintained robust growth, supply capacity was further consolidated, and the sector made positive contributions to the global green energy transition and the stability of the natural gas industry chain.

The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made comprehensive arrangements for deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization. The enactment of the Energy Law of the People’s Republic of China provided a legal framework for fundamental issues in the energy sector. Moving forward, the natural gas industry will continue to deepen market reforms, improve the "X + 1 + X" market system—characterized by diversified upstream supply, efficient midstream transportation, and competitive downstream sales—enhance security of supply, promote low-carbon transformation, and support the stable and healthy development of the industry, thereby better serving the modernization of China.

## I. Global and Domestic Natural Gas Developments in 2024

Efforts continue to improve price linkage mechanisms and support the development of LNG futures markets.

## III. Outlook for 2025

In the first half of 2025, international gas prices remained relatively high due to supply disruptions, cold weather, and inventory drawdowns. China’s gas consumption growth slowed, with a 0.9% year-on-year increase. Power generation demand grew, while industrial demand was weak. Domestic production grew by 5.8%, but imports fell by 7.8%, with pipeline imports up 10.5% and LNG imports down 20.6%.

In the second half of 2025, the global gas market is expected to remain in a fragile balance, facing uncertainties from geopolitics, weather, and economic trends. China’s macroeconomic recovery will support steady gas demand growth, with consumption expected to rise by 2–3%. Domestic production is expected to increase by over 10 billion cubic meters for the ninth consecutive year.

## Conclusion

2025 marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan and a critical year for deepening reform and advancing modernization. China’s natural gas industry will continue to promote coordinated development of production, supply, storage, and sales, improve the market system, and contribute to energy security, green transition, and the dual carbon goals. The industry aims to lay a solid foundation for the 15th Five-Year Plan and the continued high-quality development of China’s economy and society.
